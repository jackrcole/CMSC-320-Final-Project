# Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to download the R language. Visit the R Project's official website at https://www.r-project.org/about.html to download this open source statistical computing language.

Additonally, we recommend using the RStudio IDE to make managing R code easier. RStudio is available for free at https://rstudio.com/.

With that out of the way, let's get started!

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
